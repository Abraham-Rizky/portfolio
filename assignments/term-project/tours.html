                    <h4>Bike Bozeman countryside when it is most beautiful, in the afternoon leading up to sunset.</h4>
                    <p>At the end of each day the city of Bozeman starts to power down in intensity, as workers prepare to head home and visitors await evening events and dinner.

                        Before sunset is an ideal time to tour by bike and witness the residents in transition and the sites of the countryside unburdened by crowds of tourists. The heat of the day gives way quickly to a nearly surreal feeling of calm in the city, the countryside and on the pathways in and around the Big Mountain complex.

                        The evening concludes with a private boat cruise, whilst enjoying local delicacies and refreshments on board, the perfect way to end your sunset tour.

                        Bozeman at Twilight promises a glimpse of city life blended with the flavour and scenery of the countryside adjacent to the mountain scenes and finishes in the fading light of sunset in Gallatin River .</p>

                    <h4>Cycle the charming countryside of Bozeman, taste regional specialties, get hands on with local handcrafts and paddle the Gallatin river delta, exploring the places that can only be reached from the water.</h4>
                    <p>This combined bike and kayak tour will let you not only explore the countryside of Bozeman and meet the locals but also see the river life of the area.

                        Just a short cycle through Bozeman, and you will find yourself in the rural Bozeman. Cycling this area we make sure to take several stops, which includes some hands-on fun at local workshops, trails, and waterfalls.

                        After a fulfilling morning exploring on the bikes we'll enjoy a delicious lunch break at a local restaurant to get properly refuelled. Returning to the bikes we'll cycle a little further along the riverside then board kayaks to take in the sights from water level.

                        Paddling through the water at a gentle pace we'll come by the interesting sights of Bozeman that you can only fully enjoy from the water. Along the way we'll also make sure to stop at one of our special locations for a quick rest and to enjoy the view. Finishing the Kayak exploration we arrive in a different part of Bozeman, where our transport will be waiting to bring you back to your hotel.
                        A fantastic day discovering Bozeman surrounds.</p></div>
